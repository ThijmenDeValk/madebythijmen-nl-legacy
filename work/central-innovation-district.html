        <p class="text--intro">The CID Hub brings together the stakeholders of this new district, from future residents
          to the development companies. Its intense focus on citizen participation helps them design this future
          district together.</p>
        <p>Marking a stark change to the skyline of the city, the CID will house 35,000 new citizens in over 20,000 new
          houses. It includes developments of “un-Dutch” proportions, with multiple new skyscrapers dwarfing the
          currently tallest buildings of the city.</p>
        <p>The participation department of the city of The Hague asked for a space that brings together stakeholders at
          an early stage of the project. Specifically, they needed help reaching the young new residents, like students
          and young families, and skilled immigrants.</p>
        <p>For this project I was part of a student design team for The Hague University of Applied Sciences, during a
          service design course. The group consisted of six student designers. Our end goal was to create a concept, so
          you won’t find any super polished designs in this case study.</p>

      <div class="section__item">
        <p>We approached the design challenge from three angles: the status quo, the fabric of the neighbourhoods and
          the future residents. Through a series of interviews, observations and location visits we identified the
          opportunities we could tap into to bring this.
        </p>
        <p>Citizen participation isn’t a brand-new idea, so invaluable here was the existing know-how the participation
          employees of the city brought to the table. We also talked to developers of the Binckhorst, another district
          in the city going through redevelopments, where a brand new info centre had just opened its doors.</p>

      <div class="section__item">
        <p>The touchpoints in the Hub were extensively prototyped and tested. This included both on location testing of
          individual elements and a room scale mock-up of the entire experience.</p>
        <p>We made good use of the CID scale model that happened to be on display at City Hall. Visitors took part in a
          usability test with a digital prototype of the tablets we designed to complement the scale model. </p>
        <p>The overall experience was tested both in a digital 3D environment, including a photogrammetry scan of the
          scale model, and a lo-fi room scale walkthrough. Here, we tested sightlines, natural flow of the experience
          and visitor behaviour in both low and high crowd scenarios.</p>

        <p>Our final concept is a dynamic co-creation space, moving around the neighbourhoods of the district as the
          whole project progresses. The visitor journey is designed around a constantly increasing level of
          participation.</p>
        <p>While they enter as passive listeners, each step of the visit gives them both the information and confidence
          needed to step up and participate in the design questions the project faces at that given time.</p>
        <p>By embedding it in the fabric of each neighbourhood, both in physical location and with community hosted
          events, we open the floor for the people to shape their future neighbourhood together.</p>
