          district.</p>
        <p>This district will redefine the skyline of the city, housing 35,000 new citizens
          in over 20,000 new houses. As part of a student project, we were tasked with boosting participation with the
          various stakeholders in the district.</p>
        <p>Our goal was to create a space that could engage the youth and skilled migrants because these were the
          audiences that the municipality had difficulties reaching.</p>
