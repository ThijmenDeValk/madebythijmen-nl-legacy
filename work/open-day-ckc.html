        <p class="text--intro">A digital program for the yearly Open Day of CKC &amp; partners. Visitors can plan their
          day by favouriting, searching, sorting and filtering the many activities and performances.</p>
        <p>The Open Day kicks off the cultural year and has become a proud tradition of the cultural centre. The day is
          filled with a wide variety of workshops, demonstrations, and performances, so it’s important to help visitors
          find the activities best suited for them.</p>
        <p>In 2019, we introduced a digital program, replacing the massive brochure of activities printed in ever
          smaller fonts. Through searching and filtering, visitors find just the right activities for them.</p>

      <div class="section__item">
        <p>Since the coronavirus pandemic, visitors are more comfortable planning their day ahead and we introduced a
          timeslot reservation system to play into this. Now, visitors can plan out their visit by the minute and have
          guaranteed access to their workshops.</p>
        <p>Claiming a timeslot is designed to be as quick as possible. For visitors signed in with their CKC account,
          it’s a simple as tapping a button and seeing the confirmation email pop up in their inbox a second later.</p>
        <p>Just before the Open Day, visitors receive a reminder email with all the information they need to attend
          their activities, including the exact room the activity is in.</p>
        <p>For the organisers, the reservation system also allows quick adaptation to both over and underperformers.
          It’s easy to schedule some extra activities to account for a sudden influx of new drummers.</p>

        <p>When you’re busy running an Open Day, you don’t want to second guess your digital program. That’s why it’s
          built on a rock-solid foundation of a Vercel hosted Next.js frontend and a Firebase database. Sendgrid ensures
          every confirmation email gets delivered in the blink of an eye.</p>
        <p>Visitors sign in using the standardised CKC account system, an Auth0 backed authentication system used for
          all CKC &amp; partners properties. New visitors get subtly nudged to create an account.</p>

      <h2 class="section__title section__title--no-offset">Results</h2>
      <div class="section__item">
        <p>Feedback of our visitors was very positive. Plenty had prepared their list of 'must see' items beforehand,
          and more used the QR codes to quickly open up the program during the day itself. For our staff, it increased
          the speed with which they could find interesting activities that exactly fit that guest's interests.</p>
        <p>When the dust settled, a combination of analytics, reservations and marketing opt-ins allowed a thorough
          review of the performance of each activity and the event as a whole.</p>
        <p>The switch to a digital program also helped CKC &amp; partners in doing its bit for the climate: each year we
          save over 30kg of paper.</p>
